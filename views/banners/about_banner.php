	<h2>About Larry Jo</h2>
	<p>
		I am a professional photographer based in Boulder City Nevada, and I also service all surrounding communities in southern Nevada as well.  I have and am also available to travel for projects nationwide. I specialize in commercial product marketing, portraits, photojournalism, weddings, and event photography.  My style combines commercialism with conceptual photography.  
	</p>	
	<p>I work unobtrusively to capture the most candid and genuine moments while also creating mood, style, and drama with creative lighting and other artistic techniques. I believe every image should tell a story, and I visualize the final shot before I even turn on the camera. You can get a feel for my style of photography by browsing around my portfolios.  I have over 15 years experience on the cinematography field covering everything from photography to video, and audio as well.
