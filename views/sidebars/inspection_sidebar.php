		When purchasing a new home or property, you want to make sure that your purchase is a sound one.  Make sure there are no underlying problems with your water systems that could quickly become your problem after the sale.

		Let a professional at Mikes Plumbing do a thorough inspection of all the plumbing fixtures and devices in your property prior to the sale and give you a complete and honest report now rather than costly repairs in the future.
